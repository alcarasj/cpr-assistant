# Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Assistant
A smartphone app for detecting the chest compression rate during CPR (dissertation research). Evaluates the chest compression rate from the bottom-up view by harnessing and thresholding the acceleration of pixels. Tested with 88% accuracy over ideal and non-ideal environments. Report PDF available in repository. Visualisations available at `cpr-assistant.herokuapp.com`.

## Python
The solution was implemented in Python to prove the feasibility of the concept.
### Installation
Requires Python >=3.5, `pip3` and `virtualenv` to be installed on your machine.
1. Install `virtualenv` globally using `pip3` with `pip3 install virtualenv`.
2. Create a `virtualenv` named `"venv"` with `virtualenv venv`.
3. Activate the `virtualenv` with `. venv/bin/activate`.
4. Install dependencies with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
### Datasets (Test Cases)
| Code | Test Case                                                               |
|------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| L    | Subject has long, loose hair.                                           |
| S    | Subject has short hair.                                                 |
| B    | Background disturbances wholly intended to disrupt performance.         |
| C    | Crop at neck-level (the subjectâ€™s neck-level and below is cropped out). |
### Graphs
Provided that the CSV files are in the correct directories, interactive graphs may be viewed using the following command:
`python3 solution.py -d=DATASET` where `DATASET` can be one of `L1, L2, L3, S1, S2, S3, S4, LB1, LB2, LB3, SB1, SC1, SCB1`.
### Ground Truth
- Ground truth data was extracted from front view videos, designated with the suffix __GT__ (e.g. __L1_GT.mp4__) using the following command:
`python3 ground_truth_extractor.py -i=L1_GT.mp4 -v -o` (warning: this overwrites the existing data used for graphing). 
- This command calculates ground truth for dataset `L1` from the video at `./videos/GT/L1_GT.mp4` and dumps the data in a CSV at directory `./csv_gt/L1_GT.mp4.csv`. 
- CSV files outputted by the script contain the following data per column: (X, Y, S) where X is the X-coordinate of the ball in the frame, Y the Y-coordinate of the ball in the frame, and S the state observed in the frame: `S = { None, Compression, Breathing }`. Each row denotes a frame.
- For more details on command-line arguments, run `python3 ground_truth_extractor.py --help`.
### Solution
- Solution data was extracted from the bottom-up view videos, designated with the suffix __BUV__ (e.g. __L1_BUV.mp4__) using the following command:
`python3 solution.py -d=L1 -r -o -w=./weights/S1.npy` (warning: this overwrites the existing CSV used for graphs).
- This command extracts solution data for dataset `L1` from the video at `./videos/BUV/L1_BUV.mp4` using preloaded weights at `./weights/S1.npy`.
- The script `solution.py` contains parameters that may be configured accordingly: `BREATHING_MODE, LEARNING_RATE, LOOKBACK_TIME, MINIMUM_ACCELERATION, MOVING_AVG_PERIOD, MAX_TIME_FOR_UPWARD_ACCELERATION, MIN_MOVEMENT_PCG, MIN_FLOW_THRESHOLD, SCALE, MIN_BREATHING_MOVEMENT`.
- CSV files outputted by the script contain the following data per column: (vertical displacement, upward displacement sum, downward displacement sum, S, total percentage of pixels moved, vertical acceleration) where S is the state observed in the frame: `S = { None, Compression, Breathing }`. Each row denotes a frame.
- The resulting weights after each execution may be saved by providing the `-s` flag.
- For more details on command-line arguments, run `python3 solution.py --help`.

## Android
An Android application was implemented with similar logic to the Python solution. This requires further device-specific optimisations.
